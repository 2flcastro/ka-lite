Learner User Manual
=======================
**Who is a "learner"?**

Anyone who uses KA Lite primarily for learning. Learner accounts will track individual progress through videos and exercises, and learners will only be allowed to view their own data.

Accessing KA Lite
------------------
Installation is not necessary on a learner's computer, as it can be accessible through your web browser with the IP address of the server. Simply copy and paste the server's IP address into your web browser any time you'd like to access KA Lite. If you are unsure what the address is, please contact your administrator.

However, if you are not accessing KA Lite through a network or wish to run KA Lite on your own computer, please follow the Installation Guide <../installguide/installmain> first before proceeding with this user manual. Once you have done so, simply copy and paste the URL given into a web browser. 


Learner Accounts
-----------------
Learners may receive their account information from their Coaches or Administrators if their account has been preconfigured. However, it is possible for students to create their own account. To create an account, please follow the instructions below:
