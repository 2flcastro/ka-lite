Learner User Manual
=======================
**Who is a "learner"?**

Anyone who uses KA Lite primarily for learning. Learner accounts will track individual progress through videos and exercises, and learners will only be allowed to view their own data.

Accessing KA Lite
------------------
There are two ways KA Lite can be used:

#. **Set up on a network with one main server, having machines connect to this server.** If this is the setup chosen, installation is not necessary on a learner's computer, as it can be accessible through a web browser with the IP address of the server. Simply copy and paste the server's IP address into your web browser any time you'd like to access KA Lite. If you are unsure what the address is, please contact your administrator.


#. **Installed for single user, on one machine.** If you are not accessing KA Lite through a network or wish to run KA Lite on your own computer, please follow the :doc:`../installguide/install_main` first before proceeding with this user manual. Once you have done so, copy and paste the URL given during the installation process into a web browser to access KA Lite (it should be http://127.0.0.1:8008).


How to Log In
--------------
Learners may receive their account information from their Coaches or Administrators if their account has been preconfigured. However, it is possible for learners to create their own account. To create an account, please follow the instructions below:

#. Open KA Lite.
#. Click "Sign Up" at the top right of your screen. 
#. If you are redirected to a page that asks you to select a facility, please select the facility to which you belong. If you are unsure which facility you belong to, please contact your administrator or coach. Skip this step if you do not see this page.
#. Fill out the information. 
#. Click the "Create user" button when you are finished.

How to Watch Videos
--------------------
To begin watching the Khan Academy instructional videos, first make sure you are logged into KA Lite. Upon log in, you should see a green menu on the left that lists the video content. If you do not see this green menu, please start by clicking on the "Learn" tab on the home page. 

Start by selecting the subject you'd like to explore. This will expand the side menu, displaying subtopics within that subject. 

The icons to the left of the menu selections describe whether or not it is a video, an exercise, or a menu that can be further expanded:

	* |list| icons designate that the selection can be further expanded into subtopics
	* |exercise| icons designate that the selection is an exercise for that topic.
	* |video| icons designate that the selection is a video for that topic.
