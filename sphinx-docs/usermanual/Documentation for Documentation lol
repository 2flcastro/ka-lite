What I Changed:

There was a lot of stuff that was missing from the user manual, a lot of it assumes that the user has a lot of basic knowledge about networking (which, a lot of people don't. It's not in their field.) I tried to rewrite the instructions to reflect a different perspective, one that doesn't assume so much knowledge on the users' behalf....

Therefore, there were/still are a few sections that need to be added.

1. How to restart the server (there is no way to do this through the user interface? ) --there are parts in the manual where they reference restarting the server with no explanation on how to.

2. How to get your IP address (ADMIN) -- this needs to be fixed? Or still working on this, actually. Not sure on how to do this actually.... lol
just look for ipv4 on windows,
ifconfig on mac,
dunno about linux? prob the same ^




What I'm waiting on:
1. removing users from group... being able to ungroup users... this is a feature that was available in 0.12 but seems to have abug in 0.13 . section is left blank.

2. ACCESSING ka lite for admins... will there be a clickable icon? a runnable command? what exactly is it? seems like is still in its dev stages so i am also leaving that alone for now

3. screenshawts
