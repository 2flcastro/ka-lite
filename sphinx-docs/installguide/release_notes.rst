Release Notes
=============

0.13.0
------

General
^^^^^^^
Interacting with the system through ``kalite/manage.py`` has now been deprecated. Please use the kalite executable under the ``bin/`` folder. Run ``bin/kalite -h`` for more details.

If you are pulling the source from git, you will need to run the setup command to complete the upgrade. From the base directory run::

    /path/to/python/interpreter bin/kalite manage setup

On Windows, use the ``bin\windows\kalite.bat`` in the cmd.exe prompt::

    bin\windows\kalite.bat manage setup

When you are asked whether or not to delete your database, you should choose to keep your database!

Windows
^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::
    Internet Explorer 8 is no longer supported in this version. Please use a newer browser, or stick to version 0.12 to maintain compatibility.

Raspberry Pi
^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're updating a current Raspberry Pi installation, make sure to put this in your ``local_settings.py`` to avoid slow performance:

    DO_NOT_RELOAD_CONTENT_CACHE_AT_STARTUP = True
