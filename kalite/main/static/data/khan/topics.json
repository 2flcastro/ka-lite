Humans have developed a system of disposing of this waste, while retaining nutrients and substances important to our well-being. \n\n\nOur kidneys play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis, or the physiological balance of the body. Every thirty minutes, our kidneys filter the entire supply of blood in our body. Unfortunately, they are also prone to disease, which is illustrated by the fact that 1 in every 9 American adults currently has a kidney disease. Additionally, more than 82% of Americans waiting for a life-saving organ transplant is waiting for a kidney, but only 17% of these patients get one each year. \n\n\nIn this tutorial, learn how the kidneys take blood and very selectively extract waste from it to expel from the body as urine.\n", "render_type": "Tutorial", "slug": "introduction-to-the-kidneys", "kind": "Topic", "title": "Urinary system introduction"}, {"contains": ["Video"], "path": "khan/science/health-and-medicine/human-anatomy-and-physiology/introduction-to-immunology/", "children": [{"id": "O1N2rENXq_Y", "title": "Role of phagocytes in innate or nonspecific immunity", "description": "Role of phagocytes in innate or nonspecific immunity.

Slaves made up nearly 90% of Saint-Domingue's population, and in 1789 they couldn't help but hear about the revolution underway in France. All the talk of liberty, equality, and fraternity sounds pretty good to a person in bondage, and so the slaves rebelled.

While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the \"sun never set on the British Empire.\" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires.

Trench warfare and modern weapons led to battles in which tens of thousands of soldiers were killed in a day, with no ground gained for either side.

While the rest of the world was off having a couple of World Wars, China was busily uprooting the dynastic system that had ruled there for millennia. Most revolutions have some degree of tumult associated with them, but China's 20th century revolutions were REALLY disruptive. In 1911 and 1912, Chinese nationalists brought 3000 years of dynastic rule to an end. China plunged into chaos as warlords staked out regions of the country for themselves. The nationalists and communists joined forces briefly to bring the nation back together under the Chinese Republic, and then they quickly split and started fighting the Chinese Civil War. The fight between nationalists and communists went on for decades, and was interrupted by an alliance to fight the invading Japanese during World War II. After the World War II ended, the Chinese Civil War was back on. Mao and the communists were ultimately victorious, and Chiang Kai-Shek ended up in Taiwan. And then it got weird. Mao spent years repeatedly trying to purify the Communist Party and build up the new People's Republic of China with Rectifications, Anti Campaigns, Five Year Plans. the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution.

He then describes measures of relief he brought to the inhabitants of the city, and tells how he returned a number of images of gods, which Nabonidus had collected in Babylon, to their proper temples throughout Mesopotamia and western Iran. At the same time he arranged for the restoration of these temples, and organized the return to their homelands of a number of people who had been held in Babylonia by the Babylonian kings. Although the Jews are not mentioned in this document, their return to Palestine following their deportation by Nebuchadnezzar II, was part of this policy.\n\nThe cylinder is often referred to as the first bill of human rights as it appears to encourage freedom of worship throughout the Persian Empire and to allow deported people to return to their homelands, but it in fact reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium B.C.E., kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms.\u00a0\n\nIt was found in Babylon in modern Iraq in 1879 during a British Museum excavation.\n", "slug": "cyrus-cylinder", "kind": "Video", "title": "The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia"}, {"id": "mjxCTApdX3Q", "description": "Capital of a column from the audience hall of the palace of Darius I, Susa, c. 510 B.C.E., \u00a0Achaemenid, \u00a0Tell of the Apadana, Susa, Iran (Louvre)\nSpeakers: Dr. Steven Zucker & Dr. Beth Harris", "slug": "bull-capital-susa", "kind": "Video", "title": "Capital of a column from the audience hall of the palace of Darius I, Susa"}], "child_data": [{"kind": "Article", "id": "x999b1c15"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "x5d4ec510"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xe610702a"}], "id": "persian", "parent_id": "ancient-near-east1", "in_knowledge_map": false, "ancestor_ids": ["root", "humanities", "ancient-art-civilizations", "ancient-near-east1"], "description": "Western histories have often looked at the Persians only in relation to their confrontations with the ancient Greeks, but the Persian empire was long-lived, complex and sophisticated.

These structural units may be repeated and combined to form the elevation of a building and its architectural vocabulary.\n\nThere are eight Orders in total: Doric (Greek and Roman versions), Tuscan, Ionic (Greek and Roman), Corinthian (Greek and Roman), and Composite. The simplest is the Tuscan, supposedly derived from the Etruscan-type temple. It has a base and capital and a plain column. The Doric is probably earlier, however, its Greek version having no base, as on the Parthenon. The Ionic Order, with its twin volute capitals, originated in Asia Minor in the mid-6th century B.C.E. The Corinthian Order was an Athenian invention of the 5th century B.C.E. and was later developed by the Romans.

And on the day that it was carried to the Duomo the shops were shut, and the bishop conducted a great and devout company of priests and friars in solemn procession, accompanied by the nine signiors, and all the officers of the commune, and all the people, and one after another the worthiest with lighted candles in their hands took places near the picture, and behind came the women and children with great devotion. And they accompanied the said picture up to the Duomo, making the procession around the Campo, as is the custom, all the bells ringing joyously, out of reverence for so noble a picture as this.

According to legend St Ursula was an English princess who decided to go on a holy pilgrimage before her marriage. The legend also states that she took with her 11,000 virgin companions as company for the journey.\n\nThe troop of 11,000 virgins travelled to Cologne, Basle and Rome and made their way home back through Cologne. It was here that they met with a group of pagan Huns, whose leader wanted to marry Ursula. Ursula being already engaged and a virgin refused! This made the Huns so angry that they murdered all 11,000 of the girls by arrow fire.\n\n11,000 virgins is certainly a large party \u2013 the legend of there being 11,000 virgins became fixed in the 10th century, but this was probably through a misunderstanding of a Latin numerical inscription which read 11 rather than 11,000!

She was the only one of the Gorgons who was subject to mortality. She is celebrated for her personal charms and the beauty of her locks. Neptune became enamoured of her, and obtained her favours in the temple of Minerva. This violation of the sanctity of the temple provoked Minerva, and she changed the beautiful locks of Medusa, which had inspired Neptune\u2019s love to serpents.\n\nAccording to Apollodorus, Medusa and her sisters came into the world with snakes on their heads, instead of hair, with yellow wings and brazen hands. Their bodies were also covered with impenetrable scales, and their very looks had the power of killing or turning to stones. Perseus rendered his name immortal by his conquest of Medusa. He cut off her head, and the blood that dropped from the wound produced the innumerable serpents that infest Africa. The conqueror placed Medusa's head on the shield of Minerva, which he had used in his expedition. The head still retained the same petrifying power as before, as it was fatally known in the court of Cepheus. . . .

He pays little heed to Venus, his mistress, who, accompanied by Amors and Cupids, strives with caresses and emraces to hold him. From the other side, Mars is dragged forward by the Fury Alekto, with a torch in her hand. Near by are monsters personifying Pestilence and Famine, those inseparable partners of War. On the ground, turning her back, lies a woman with a broken lute, representing Harmony, which is incompatible with the discord of War. There is also a mother with her child in her arms, indicating that fecundity, procreation and charity are thwarted by War, which corrupts and destroys everything. In addition, one sees an architect thrown on his back, with his instruments in his hand, to show that which in time of peace is constructed for the use and ornamentation of the City, is hurled to the ground by the force of arms and falls to ruin. I believe, if I remember rightly, that you will find on the ground, under the feet of Mars, a book and a drawing on paper, to imply that he treads underfoot all the arts and letters. There ought also to be a bundle of darts or arrows, with the band which held them together undone; these when bound form the symbol of Concord. Beside them is the caduceus and an olive branch, attribute of Peace; these are also cast aside. That grief-stricken woman clothed in black, with torn veil, robbed of all her jewles and other ornaments, is the unfortunate Europe who, for so many years now, has suffered plunder, outrage, and misery, which are so injurious to everyone, that it is unnecessary to go into detail. Europe's attribute is the globe, borne by a small angel or genius, and surmounted by the cross, to symbolize the Christian world.

In this painting, which measures more than 17 feet high and 23 feet wide, Gros depicted a legendary episode from Napoleon's campaigns in Egypt (1798-1801). On March 21, 1799, \u00a0in a make-shift hospital in Jaffa, Napoleon visited his troops who were stricken with the Bubonic Plague. Gros depicts Napoleon attempting to calm the growing panic about contagion by fearlessly \u00a0touching the sores of one of the plague victims. Like earlier neoclassical paintings such as David's Death of Marat, Gros combines Christian iconography, in this case Christ healing the sick, with a contemporary subject. He also draws on the art of classical antiquity, by depicting Napoleon in the same position as the ancient Greek sculpture, the Apollo Belvedere. In this way, he imbues Napoleon with divine qualities while simultaneously showing him as a military hero. But in contrast to David, Gros uses warm, sensual colors and focuses on the dead and dying who occupy the foreground of the painting. We see the same approach later in Delacroix's painting ofLiberty Leading the People (1830). Napoleon was a master at using art to manipulate his public image. In reality he had ordered the death of the prisoners who he could not afford to house or feed, and poisoned his troops who were dying from the plague as he retreated from Jaffa.\n", "slug": "gros-napoleon-bonaparte-visiting-the-pest-house-in-jaffa-1804", "kind": "Video", "title": "Gros, Napoleon Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Stricken in Jaffa"}, {"id": "lSV-J1JHDFY", "description": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814, Oil on canvas, 36\" x 63\" (91 x 162 cm), (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris)", "slug": "ingres-la-grande-odalisque-1814", "kind": "Video", "title": "Ingres, La Grande Odalisque"}, {"id": "sQpAYcxSVEg", "description": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres,\u00a0Princesse de Broglie, oil on canvas,\u00a01851\u201353\u00a0(The Metropolitan Museum of Art).\u00a0Speakers:\u00a0Dr. Beth Harris,\u00a0Dr. Steven Zucker", "slug": "ingres-princess-de-broglie-1851-53", "kind": "Video", "title": "Ingres, Princesse de Broglie"}, {"id": "ingres--la-grande-odalisque-quiz", "title": "Ingres, La Grande Odalisque (quiz)", "description": "Test your knowledge.", "slug": "ingres-la-grande-odalisque-quiz", "kind": "Exercise"}, {"id": "CXsstWSXh68", "description": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Raphael and the Fornarina, 1814, Oil on canvas, 64.77 x 53.34 cm (25 1/2 x 21 in.)

However, he was not interested in mirroring polite parlor conversations and middle class promenades in the Bois de \u00a0Boulogne (Paris\u2019 Central Park). Rather, Manet invented subjects that set the Parisians\u2019 teeth on edge.\u00a0\n\nIn 1865, Manet submitted his risqu\u00e9 painting of a courtesan greeting her client (in this case, you), Olympia, of 1863, to the French Salon. The jury for the 1865 Salon accepted this painting despite their disapproval of the subject matter, because two years earlier, Manet\u2019s Luncheon on the Grass created such a stir when it was rejected from the Salon. (It was instead exhibited in Emperor Napoleon III\u2019s conciliatory exhibition\u2014the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s, or the Exhibition of the Refused. Crowds came to the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s specifically to laugh and jeer at what they considered Manet\u2019s folly.)\n\nSomehow they were afraid another rejection would seem like a personal attack on Manet himself. The reasoning was odd, but the result was the same\u2014Olympia became infamous and the painting had to be hung very high to protect it from physical attacks.\u00a0\n\nManet was a Realist, but sometimes his \u201creal\u201d situations shocked and rocked the Parisian art world to its foundations. His later work was much tamer.\n\n(Text by Dr. Beth Gersh-Nesic)\n", "slug": "manet-olympia-1863-exhibited-1865", "kind": "Video", "title": "Manet, Olympia"}, {"id": "manet-s-olympia-quiz", "title": "Manet's Olympia Quiz", "description": "This quiz is for the video Manet, Olympia.", "slug": "manet-s-olympia-quiz", "kind": "Exercise"}, {"id": "Nb_4nEFyeGk", "description": "\u00c9douard Manet, Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe (Luncheon on the Grass), oil on canvas, 1863 (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker", "slug": "manet-le-d-jeuner-sur-l-herbe-luncheon-on-the-grass-1863", "kind": "Video", "title": "Manet, Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe"}, {"id": "znKX9WcowfY", "description": "\u00c9douard Manet, \u00c9mile Zola, 1868, oil on canvas, 57 x 45 inches or 146.5 x 114 cm\n(Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nThis portrait was painted in appreciation for the support Zola gave to Manet in his\n1866 essay in La Revue du XXe si\u00e8cle and during Manet's independent exhibition \nheld along side the Universal Exposition in 1867.", "slug": "manet-mile-zola-1868", "kind": "Video", "title": "Manet, \u00c9mile Zola"}, {"id": "XS8OhYdc-20", "description": "\u00c9douard Manet, The Balcony, 1868-69, oil on canvas, 66-1/2 x 44-1/4 inches (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nSpeakers: Drs.

Here she depicts a fashionable upper-class woman in a box seat at the Paris opera (as it happens, the sitter is Cassatt's sister, Lydia). Lydia is shown holding opera glasses up to her eyes; but instead of tilting them down, as she would if she were watching the performance below, her gaze is level. She peers straight across the chamber perhaps at another member of the audience. Look closely and you will notice that, in turn, and in one of the boxes across the room, a gentleman is gazing at her.

These structural units may be repeated and combined to form the elevation of a building and its architectural vocabulary.\n\nThere are eight Orders in total: Doric (Greek and Roman versions), Tuscan, Ionic (Greek and Roman), Corinthian (Greek and Roman), and Composite. The simplest is the Tuscan, supposedly derived from the Etruscan-type temple. It has a base and capital and a plain column. The Doric is probably earlier, however, its Greek version having no base, as on the Parthenon. The Ionic Order, with its twin volute capitals, originated in Asia Minor in the mid-6th century B.C.E. The Corinthian Order was an Athenian invention of the 5th century B.C.E. and was later developed by the Romans. The Composite Order is a late Roman combination of elements from the Ionic and Corinthian Orders.\n\nThe Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms, Michael Clarke, Deborah Clarke. \u00a9 2012 Oxford University Press.

Later, postmodern theory influenced art making and the study of art. In addition, artists were affected by exposure to diverse cultures, largely as a result of colonialism.

However, he was not interested in mirroring polite parlor conversations and middle class promenades in the Bois de \u00a0Boulogne (Paris\u2019 Central Park). Rather, Manet invented subjects that set the Parisians\u2019 teeth on edge.\u00a0\n\nIn 1865, Manet submitted his risqu\u00e9 painting of a courtesan greeting her client (in this case, you), Olympia, of 1863, to the French Salon. The jury for the 1865 Salon accepted this painting despite their disapproval of the subject matter, because two years earlier, Manet\u2019s Luncheon on the Grass created such a stir when it was rejected from the Salon. (It was instead exhibited in Emperor Napoleon III\u2019s conciliatory exhibition\u2014the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s, or the Exhibition of the Refused. Crowds came to the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s specifically to laugh and jeer at what they considered Manet\u2019s folly.)\n\nSomehow they were afraid another rejection would seem like a personal attack on Manet himself. The reasoning was odd, but the result was the same\u2014Olympia became infamous and the painting had to be hung very high to protect it from physical attacks.\u00a0\n\nManet was a Realist, but sometimes his \u201creal\u201d situations shocked and rocked the Parisian art world to its foundations.

The reconstruction of his grave illustrates the early Egyptian custom of placing the body in a contracted, foetal position, usually on the left side, with the head to the south, facing the west, the land of the dead where he would be reborn. Around him were all the things he might need for his afterlife, especially pottery to hold and serve food.\nBefore the pharaohs\n\nIn the Predynastic period (4400-3100 B.C.E.), the time before the pharaohs, the dead were buried in shallow graves cut into the desert sand. The graves were often lined with reed mats, making them like a bed, and the body was covered with linen or skins and more mats, like a blanket, before the grave was refilled and perhaps topped by a mound of dirt. Contact with the hot dry sand naturally preserved the bodies because the sand absorbed the water that constitutes approximately 75% by weight of the human body. Bacteria cannot breed without moisture and as a result, the bodies frequently did not decay, but simply dried out. The body of this man is remarkably well-preserved, even down to his finger-nails and hair, which has probably faded with time.\n\nChance discoveries of these sand-dried mummies (for example, when a grave was disturbed by animals or robbers), may have promoted the belief that physical preservation of the body was necessary for the afterlife. This may have led the later Egyptians to develop means of artificial mummification after the introduction of coffins and deeper graves separated the body from the natural drying effects of the sand.\n\nThe objects that surrounded Gebelein Man in his original burial are unknown. On display\u00a0is a selection of typical grave-goods from other graves of the middle Predynastic period (about 3500 B.C.E.), the time we believe he died. Attempts to date the body using Carbon 14 (the radiocarbon method) have so far been unsuccessful.\nHe has been in the British Museum collection for over 100 years, but it was not until 2012 that he was CT scanned for the first time. Detailed images created from the CT scans' high resolution X-rays are allowing us to look inside his body and learn about his life and his death in ways never before possible. \u00a9 Trustees of the British Museum", "slug": "virtual-autopsy", "kind": "Video", "title": "Gebelein Man: virtual autopsy, exploring a natural mummy from early Egypt"}], "child_data": [{"kind": "Article", "id": "x5c7fbd2e"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "x8ac544e8"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "x38457cd0"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "x99246888"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "xb4d6d345"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "xeaf0a1ef"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "x3d20e1ef"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "xbb36ed1b"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xf82795ed"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "x23ffa641"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xd0145be8"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xe5a36d90"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "x7c772e9a"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xe5a1b46b"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "x05431aff"}], "id": "ancient-egypt-bm", "parent_id": "africa1", "in_knowledge_map": false, "ancestor_ids": ["root", "partner-content", "british-museum", "africa1"], "description": "Towards the end of the fourth millennium B.C.E. several independent city-states were unified to form a single state, marking the beginning of over 3,000 years of pharaonic civilization in the Nile Valley.
