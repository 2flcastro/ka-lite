[Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/)'s core mission is to "provide a free world-class education for anyone anywhere", and with 70% of the world's population not having access to the internet, providing an alternative delivery mechanism for Khan Academy content is key to fulfilling this mission.

Khan Academy Lite is a lightweight Django web app for hosting core Khan Academy content (videos and exercises) from a local server, without needing internet connectivity. Primary use cases include:
* Mobile school "vans", which transport a server and multiple laptops/tablets between a number of schools/orphanages in remote communities on a rotating basis, and syncing up with a central database (to download new content and upload analytics) when in an area with internet connectivity.
* For servers/computer labs located in remote schools, which could be slowly syncing with a central server over a cell network or via USB keys.
