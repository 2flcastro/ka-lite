# in one tab, run the following, which drops you into a transient instance
docker run -i -t ka-lite-installed /bin/bash

# make your changes in there, then when you want to save it, in another tab, do:
docker ps
# to see the processes that are running -- identify yours, and copy its process ID

# overwrite the "ka-lite-installed" image with the current state of your process
# (you should not have the server running inside the image when you do this, or the pid will persist)
docker commit <proc_id> ka-lite-installed
